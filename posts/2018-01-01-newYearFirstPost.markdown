title: Resolution, reflection, and repetition
---

I'm not normally the sort of person who makes new year's resolutions. By not normally I mean that I've never made a new year's resolution before. <!--more-->In the past I felt that any major life changes could occur at any time and did not need to be "saved" for the arbitrary ticking over of the calendar.

This year, however, it felt appropriate to set a bit of a challenge and a long term goal for myself. I'm currently in the process of finishing my PhD (I have my viva at the end of February) and after four years of being so focused on a single goal I feel a bit at loose ends so I'm setting myself the challenge of blogging once per week during 2018.

This goal has a few main objectives: 

   1. I want to become more comfortable writing quickly
   2. I want to continue to improve my writing ability
   3. I want to start building more of a diverse online portfolio for myself

My first objective was inspired by my writing process for my PhD thesis. I have always had a difficult time trying to write the first draft of papers with the editing process going much smoother. This pattern was amplified horribly while writing my thesis. I experienced agonizing writers block trying to get those first words on paper throughout writing up my thesis. I'm hoping that by forcing myself to produce *something* each week I can work through some of this writers block.

The second goal, to improve my writing ability, should be fairly obvious. I am pretty happy with my writing but it can always be improved. I've always admired people who can communicate very well through writing and the only way I know how to improve my own skills is via copious practice. 

The third major goal is less well defined than the others but is perhaps the one I'm most motivated by. While completing my PhD I have obviously been highly focused on a few very specific topics. Now that I'm (mostly) done with that degree I am able to branch out a bit more and pick up some new skills. Additionally with any non-thesis related work I did do during my degree very little of it ever made it into a state that could be shared with another human. I'm hoping that by forcing to write about something each week I will delve into projects more in depth so that I have topics to write about and that I will polish whatever I do a bit more so that I can share with others what I've done.

I think this has been long enough for a first post. In the coming weeks I hope to continue to configure this Hakyll site so it is a bit more aesthetically pleasing. My first major project that I'm currently working is I'm working on learning some game theory. I've been interested in learning game theory for some time but haven't been able to give it enough attention until now. I'm reading John Conway's "On Numbers and Games" and I've enrolled onto [a Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1/home/welcome) on Game Theory as well. We'll see if I can continue to keep moving through both of these things but I hope one or the other will provide topics to write about soon.

That's all for now
