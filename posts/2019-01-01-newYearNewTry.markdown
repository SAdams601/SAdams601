Well, if my plans this time last year had happened, this could have been a triumphant final post after a year of writing consistently. One look at the archive of this blog will tell you that this will not be that triumphant post. Instead this post is going up at the start of 2019 and I only produced two blog posts last year. 

Life goes on, even with a lack of blogging, and it has been an incredible year for me. I defended and corrected my PhD thesis, and graduated from the programme. I got married to the most wonderful women and had great fun at our wedding. Finally work continues on. I've accepted a permanent contract at the bank, working on the site reliability engineering team. Our first product is rapidly heading toward production currently and I expect to remain busy for the next year at least. 

From a personal projects point of view it has also been a fairly successful year. I've gotten into the habit of working on my train commute and have done a ton of reading and working this past year during that time. In particular I've been getting to grips with theorem provers and dependently typed programming languages. It all started when I discovered Benjamin Pierce's Software Foundations [@softwareFoundations] which introduces the mathematics of software verification using the Coq theorem prover. I ended up getting quite bogged down by Coq in the middle of the first volume and felt like I was really just guessing which tactics I should apply to the goal and trying stuff until it worked out. I found this to be an unsatisfying approach, and was frustrated because the material I was really interested in was in volumes two and three.

I was very fortunate that at around this time Phil Wadler posted a link to his work with Wen Kokke on translating Software Foundations into Agda [@agdaFoundations]. Phil had the similar observations about having to become proficient at Coq before you can begin to work on the actual 'software foundations' parts of the original work so he decided to write a book that ["covers much of the same ground as SF, although it is not a slavish imitation"](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/agda.html#sbmf). My initial impression of the book was that it seemed to cover much of same background information as SF it wasn't as approachable to someone unfamiliar with Agda as SF is towards someone who has never used Coq before. 

Since the dependent type system was the most confusing part about using Agda so I've begun working on learning dependent types. The favourite resource that I've found so far is __The Little Typer__ [@littleTyper]. I have not read any of the other books in the "little schemer" series but this entry has been very enjoyable and approachable so far. Other resources that I've used as well that I've found useful are __Type-driven development with Idris__ [@tddIdris] and __Verified functional programming in Agda__ [@verifiedAgda]. I hope to feel comfortable enough to begin working through Software Foundations in Agda soon.

## Other things I'm working on

I've also begun doing some reading on natural language processing. I've always had a passing interest in the field and NLP was mentioned as one of the applications of category theory so it has caught my eye properly again. I'm currently coming to grips with how the vector space model of word meaning works but in the future I want to checkout these two papers:

* A Compositional Explanation of the 'Pet Fish' Phenomenon [@petFish]
* Hierarchical conceptual spaces for concept combination [@lewisHierarchical]

Finally happy new year and hopefully this year contains more consistent blogging from me!
