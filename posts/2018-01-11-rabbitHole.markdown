In the last post I mentioned that I was trying to learning some game theory. I'm still working towards that goal but this journey is taking me in directions I wasn't expecting. 

Most of my efforts up until this point had been working through the first few chapters of "On Numbers and Games." Comprehending it was difficult but I felt like I was making slow progress. It's probably important to say that for quite a while I was still working through "Chapter 0" the interestingly named first chapter. In this chapter Conway sets up his new way of constructing numbers. These types of numbers would eventually be named the "Surreal Numbers" by Donald Knuth in his book by the same name
