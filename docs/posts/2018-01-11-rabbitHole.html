<p>In the last post I mentioned that I was trying to learning some game theory. I'm still working towards that goal but this journey is taking me in directions I wasn't expecting.</p>
<p>Most of my efforts up until this point had been working through the first few chapters of &quot;On Numbers and Games.&quot; <span class="citation">[1]</span> Comprehending it was difficult but I felt like I was making slow but definite progress. It's probably important to note that this progress was all contained within &quot;Chapter 0&quot; the first chapter. This chapter is where Conway sets up his new way of constructing the numbers. These types of numbers would eventually be named the &quot;Surreal Numbers&quot; by Donald Knuth in his book by the same name <span class="citation">[2]</span>.</p>
<p>The next few chapters continued to prove the properties of the surreal numbers and, unfortunately, my ability to understand the material dropped dramatically. I've never studied abstract algebra and it seems like I'll need to pick up some of it to be able to understand the games half of the book. Conway provides a very handy chapter dependency graph that indicates I need to understand chapters 0 and 6 of the numbers section to be able to do the games half of the book but this half is heavily dependent on abstract algebra. This means that even if I skip up to chapter six, &quot;The Curious Field On<sub>2</sub>,&quot; I will still need at least a little bit of abstract algebra to understand it.</p>
<p>I went in search of good resources for self-study and stack overflow had a few answers that pointed me towards <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-703-modern-algebra-spring-2013/">this MIT open courseware</a> offering called &quot;Modern Algebra&quot;. The course uses two primary texts, the online and open source &quot;Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications&quot; by Tom Judson (<a href="http://abstract.ups.edu/">found here</a>), and &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot; by I.N. Herstein.</p>
<p>The readings for the MIT course begin on chapter 3 of the Judson text and my completionist leanings told me that I should at least take a look at the first two chapters which cover sets, equivalence relations, and the integers.</p>
<p>I have had some set theory as an undergraduate as part of a discrete maths course but never really put the time into understanding it (this is an unfortunately common theme throughout my mathematical education). Currently I'm almost finished with the exercises for the first chapter of the Judson book and look forward to beginning the second chapter on integers. After that I'll pick up where the MIT course begins.</p>
<p>In the meantime doing all of this set theory has made me face up to some of my deficiencies as a mathematician. If I'm going to get serious about learning these topics I should probably become more comfortable with sets because they are the foundation for so many other concepts. In that spirit I discovered &quot;Basic Set Theory&quot; by Shen and Vereschagin<span class="citation">[3]</span>. It's a part of the American Mathematical Society's &quot;Student Mathematical Library&quot; and came highly recommended. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived to have recieved a small book (just over 100 pages long) that covers the main topics of naive set theory. I look forward to reading it mostly for the exercises. They seem very creative and different from other introductions to sets that I've encountered.</p>
<p>Well now I seem to be juggling quite a bit of work on top of a full time job! Oh well, I have quite a long commute and for now I'm enjoying my time back in the world of mathematics and I hope pretty soon I'll have some ideas to work on and share here. I think I might share some of my proofs I did as part of the exercises and summaries of what I've been working on but I would like to find something more substantial to work on as well.</p>
<p>I couldn't have imagined I would end up in this position but down the rabbit hole I go!</p>
