title: About
---
My name is Stephen Adams. I am currently finishing my PhD in computing from the University of Kent. 
My thesis is titled \"Data-Driven Refactorings for Haskell\" wherein I describe the development of \"data-driven\" refactorings. 
These refactorings help evolve the data types of Haskell programs. The latex version of my thesis can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/SAdams601/thesis and the branch of HaRe (the **Ha**skell **Re**factorer) where most
of my work is also on GitHub https://github.com:SAdams601/HaRe.git.

This website is my personal blog.
